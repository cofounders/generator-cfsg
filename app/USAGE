Description:
    Creates an app using the Cofounders frontend stack

Example:
    yo cfsg

    This will guide you through a few steps to describe the app. A full-blown
    frontend stack will be generated. Ready to rock!

    Warning: Be careful when running this in an existing project directory.
    When in doubt, compare the difference between generated and existing files.

    Once ready, run `npm start` to launch the app. To run in debug mode, run
    `grunt dev`. To run all tests run `npm test`.

    See `README.md` for additional information on getting started with the
    Cofounders frontend stack.
