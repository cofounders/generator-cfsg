Description:
    Adds an external CDNJS JavaScript or CSS dependency to the app

Example:
    yo cfsg:cdnjs

    Enter an optional search query or leave blank to browse the full list of
    libraries hosted on CDNJS.

    Choose a version. Defaults to the latest version available.

    Choose which JavaScript dependency to include. This configures RequireJS
    to load the file from CDNJS, and exposes it in the app. A single file is
    allowed.

    Choose which CSS dependencies to import. The CSS file is linked from CDNJS,
    not copied to our local project. This is typically better for client-side
    performance and reduces hosting requirements. Multiple CSS files can be
    imported.

    Note: Shims are not automatically created. If the dependency does not
    implement asynchronous module definitions (AMD), add a shim to:
        /source/js/loader.js
